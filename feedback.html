        We’re really glad you’re feeling a little lighter 🤍  
        Sharing what’s inside you takes courage, and even small relief matters.
        You didn’t keep it all bottled up — that itself is progress.

        Thank you for being honest with yourself 🤍  
        Sometimes talking doesn’t instantly change how we feel — and that’s okay.
        You still took an important step by expressing yourself.

    {% elif feeling == "worse" %}
      <div class="message-box">
        We’re really sorry you’re feeling this way 🤍  
        Please remember: feeling worse doesn’t mean you failed.
        You’re not weak, and you don’t have to go through this alone.
        Reaching out again is always okay.

      <div class="message-box">
        Listening can be emotionally steady and quiet — and that’s valid 💛  
        You showed up and offered space without judgment.
        That kind of support is meaningful, even if it feels subtle.
      </div>

      <div class="message-box">
        We appreciate you sharing this honestly 💛  
        Supporting others can sometimes feel heavy.
        Please take care of yourself too — your well-being matters just as much.
